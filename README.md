# Pong game

1. Open index.html with a browser (e.g. Chrome or Firefox).
2. Open game.js with a text editor (e.g. Notepad, TextEdit, Sublime)
3. Whenever you make a change to game.js, reload the page in your browser

## Tips

Every item has a position, this is where it is on the screen:

    ball.position.top <- how far from the top
    ball.position.left <- how far from the left

Every item has a velocity (speed):

    ball.velocity.top <- how fast to move from the top
    ball.velocity.left <- how fast to move from the left

Every item has a size:

    ball.size.height
    ball.size.width

Each player has a score:
    player1.score


## Helpful tools

Use console.log() to see what things are (when you view console in your browser):

    console.log(ball.position);

Use alert() to make a pop up message:

    alert(player1.score);
